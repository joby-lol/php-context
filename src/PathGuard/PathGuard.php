/**
 * Generic interface for classes that are used to check if a file is allowed to be used in some way, be that including,
 * reading, writing, etc. The default implementations are designed to be simple and easy to use, but you can create your
 * own. The built-in interfaces based on this one are:
 *
 * * IncludeGuard (for checking if a file can be included, used in the Invoker when including files)
 * * ReadGuard (for checking if a file is allowed to be read)
 * * WriteGuard (for checking if a file is allowed to be written)
 *
 * File rules take precedence over directory rules, and after that deny rules take precedence over allow rules. This
 * means that you can allow a directory, but deny files or subdirectories within it. It also means that you can deny a
 * directory, but allow specific files within it.
